/**
 * Generic keyed state-block recorder shared by the D3D8 and D3D9 backends.
 *
 * BeginStateBlock/EndStateBlock semantics are identical in both APIs: Set* calls
 * between Begin and End are journaled (NOT applied — the recorder's caller gates
 * that) and a later Apply replays them. Re-setting the same state while recording
 * overwrites the previous entry in place (keyed dedup), preserving first-write
 * ordering like the real runtime's per-state capture masks.
 *
 * Entry types differ per API (D3D9 uses COM pointers, D3D8 DWORD tokens), so the
 * recorder is generic over the entry type with a caller-supplied key function.
