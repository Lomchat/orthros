# API layer and draw submission: what keeps them cheap

The JavaScript API layer (Win32 / Direct3D / D3DX handlers) and the Direct3D draw submission are the `api` and `draw`
categories of the frame accounting (docs/frame-accounting.md). This page lists the mechanisms that keep their cost per
frame down, all generic (no game-specific code), and how to switch them off within a session to measure them.

## Calls that never leave the translated code (src/cpu/jit/runtime.js, fastApi)

- **Pure D3DX math** (`fast-d3dx.js`): `D3DXMatrixInverse` and `D3DXVec{2,3,4}CatmullRom` for every `d3dx9_NN.dll`, in
  WASM with the JavaScript handlers' f64 operations in the same order (bit-exact results; only a NaN's sign and payload
  may differ, as they already do between the handler's interpreted and optimized runs). Test: `jit-fast-d3dx.test.js`.
- **`ID3DXEffect::GetParameterDesc`** (`FID_PARAM_DESC`): the handler keeps the 44-byte description of a parameter asked by
  handle in a direct-mapped cache after the effect's handle block; later calls with that handle are a copy. Test:
  `jit-param-desc.test.js`.
- **`ID3DXEffect::SetRawValue`** joins the deferred queue (`DEFER_RAW`): a copy of its bytes (whole words, up to 1 KiB) is
  taken at the call. Test: `jit-defer-raw.test.js`.

## Scheduler

`Sleep(0)` / `SwitchToThread` at top level end the thread's slice only when another thread can run (after the wake-up
pass a slice end would make); otherwise they return at once, as on Windows (`Scheduler.yieldFrom`, `sched-yield.test.js`).
A thread polling with `Sleep(0)` for its frame deadline is pacing: its calls are cheaper, so it makes more of them
before the 1 ms throttle parks it; the `api` time charged to `Sleep` is that polling, not work.

## Effects (src/win32/d3dx9-effect.js)

- Shader constants are compared per stage: a pass's bindings are compared with the device's registers only when that
  stage's constants changed (`vsConstVersion` / `psConstVersion` on the devices, recorded for the render worker too).
- A pass state (render / stage / sampler state, shader) the device already holds is not sent again, at `BeginPass`
  and at `End`'s restore (the device handler would do nothing).
- How a pass state picks its shader is resolved once per pass; a texture parameter set to the texture it holds does
  not take and drop a reference.

## WebGL backend (src/gfx/d3d8-webgl.js, applyState)

- The depth / stencil / blend / color mask / culling block is skipped while the render state table's version, the target's
  orientation and the GL state cache are those of the previous draw (`StateTable.ver`).
- A stage's sampler object is kept while its sampler (DX8: stage) states and its texture did not change.
- A texture whose levels are all uploaded and clean is not scanned at each bind (`levelsClean`, cleared by
  `Surface.dirty` / `markLocked`).
- Vertex and pixel constants are synced per stage only when that stage's constants changed; integer / boolean constant
  and bump-environment uniform locations are cached per program.

Test: `gl-state-cache.test.js` drives random Direct3D 8 / 9 sessions over a GL that tracks its effective state and checks
that every draw sees the same GL state, and every upload the same data, with and without these caches.

## Measuring within a session

Harness inputs (tools/headless.mjs): `dbg:ORTHROS_API_OPT_OFF=1` switches all of the above off (`=` back on);
`dbg:ORTHROS_GL_NOCACHE=1` only the backend's caches; `dbg:ORTHROS_D3DX_FAST_OFF=1` only the JIT fast paths. Scenarios
`tools/scenarios/{bfme2,rotwk}-apiopt-{ab,ba}.txt` alternate 20 s phases on / off in play (both orders). Tools:
`tools/draw-bench.mjs` (device + backend per draw over a counting GL), `tools/setter-bench.mjs` (the queued setters).
