# API layer and draw submission: what keeps them cheap

The JavaScript API layer (Win32 / Direct3D / D3DX handlers) and the Direct3D draw submission are the `api` and `draw`
categories of the frame accounting (docs/frame-accounting.md). This page lists the mechanisms that keep their cost per
frame down, all generic (no game-specific code), and how to switch them off within a session to measure them.

## Calls that never leave the translated code (src/cpu/jit/runtime.js, fastApi)

- **Pure D3DX math** (`fast-d3dx.js`): `D3DXMatrixInverse` and `D3DXVec{2,3,4}CatmullRom` for every `d3dx9_NN.dll`, in
  WASM with the JavaScript handlers' f64 operations in the same order (bit-exact results; only a NaN's sign and payload
  may differ, as they already do between the handler's interpreted and optimized runs). Test: `jit-fast-d3dx.test.js`.
- **`ID3DXEffect::GetParameterDesc`** (`FID_PARAM_DESC`): the handler keeps the 44-byte description of a parameter asked by
  handle in a direct-mapped cache after the effect's handle block; later calls with that handle are a copy. Test:
  `jit-param-desc.test.js`.
- **`ID3DXEffect::SetRawValue`** joins the deferred queue (`DEFER_RAW`): a copy of its bytes (whole words, up to 1 KiB) is
  taken at the call. Test: `jit-defer-raw.test.js`.
- **Bindings that change nothing** (`DEFER_F_TEX / STREAM / IB`): a Direct3D 9 `SetTexture`, `SetStreamSource` or
  `SetIndices` of what is bound already is dropped, as redundant render / stage / sampler states were (BFME2 play: ~17 k such
  calls/s reached JavaScript). The device keeps their shadow entries; an effect's commit list names the textures a
  queued `CommitChanges` may bind. Test: `jit-defer-filter.test.js` (randomized, against executing every call), and
  `d3dx9-effect-commit-list.test.js`.
- The queued COM calls run straight on their object's method (`Com.callQueued`), `dispatch` only for unusual cases.

## Sleep(0): pacing, not work

In play, `Sleep` is the second item of the API time ranking (BFME2: 1.1-1.4 s of API time per 20 s, 30-40 k calls/s).
Those calls are a frame limiter polling the clock with `Sleep(0)` until its next frame (the main thread: millions of
`Sleep(0)`, its other calls `timeGetTime` on the fast path) — pacing that the accounting cannot tell from work. Making the
call cheaper was tried (a `Sleep(0)` with no other thread runnable returning at once without ending the slice): the poll
then ran more often, and the time charged to `Sleep` grew (per 20 s, on vs off in one session: 1438 / 1124 ms, 846 k /
677 k calls) with no frame-time effect; it was reverted. The existing throttle (32 back-to-back `Sleep(0)` with nothing
else to run park the thread 1 ms) is what bounds it.

## Effects (src/win32/d3dx9-effect.js)

- Shader constants are compared per stage: a pass's bindings are compared with the device's registers only when that
  stage's constants changed (`vsConstVersion` / `psConstVersion` on the devices, recorded for the render worker too).
- A pass state (render / stage / sampler state, shader) the device already holds is not sent again, at `BeginPass`
  and at `End`'s restore (the device handler would do nothing).
- A sampler parameter whose states are constants is not compared again at each commit while its register's state
  table is unchanged since they were applied (`StateTable.ver`).
- How a pass state picks its shader is resolved once per pass; a texture parameter set to the texture it holds does
  not take and drop a reference.
- A parameter's version moves only when a setter changed one of its words: BFME2 play sets ~1 600 parameters per frame,
  three in four to the value they hold, and an unmoved version leaves the shader bindings (and preshaders) reading it
  alone. Parameter blocks still record such writes.
- Float constants are moved as raw words: a binding whose components are all float words (or zeros) is gathered from
  the parameter's words and compared with the registers' words in one pass (no copy, no float decode / encode); the
  float setters store the words they are given. Bits are kept (-0, NaN payloads): -0 against +0 counts as a change (one
  upload more), never the other way round. Other bindings (integers or bools in float registers, integer / bool
  registers) go through fillers specialised by output type.
- A shader's sampler binding keeps the register state table it applied its constant states to: while that table is
  unchanged only the texture is compared. Device methods are resolved once per effect (no lookup by name per call);
  parameter handles index a slot array.
- Measured (2026-10-06): `tools/effect-bind-bench.mjs` 1.4-1.8 ms -> 0.65-0.7 ms per frame of 300 objects; BFME2
  play in Node, in-session A/B with `dbg:ORTHROS_FX_BIND_OFF` (5 pairs of 20 s phases, 2 runs): api -0.25 and -0.37 ms
  per frame, every pair lower; RotWK -0.14 / -0.16 ms; browser, concurrent BFME2 phase runs against the previous
  build (`--gl-discard`): api -0.8 ms per frame (every 20 s phase -0.7 to -1.0) and -0.3 to -1.0 ms in a second
  pair, `BeginPass` (which also runs the queued setters) -0.2 to -0.3 ms.
- Not kept: register ownership (each register remembering the binding that wrote it, so that a binding left unchanged
  but on a stage changed by others needs no comparison). BFME2 play: 79 % of shader binds find their stage unchanged,
  the bindings of the others changed with their parameters; unchanged bindings on a changed stage were 0.25 % of the
  visits, 3 % of those still owned — less than the bookkeeping cost.

## WebGL backend (src/gfx/d3d8-webgl.js, applyState)

- The depth / stencil / blend / color mask / culling block is skipped while the render state table's version, the target's
  orientation and the GL state cache are those of the previous draw (`StateTable.ver`).
- A stage's sampler object is kept while its sampler (DX8: stage) states and its texture did not change.
- A texture whose levels are all uploaded and clean is not scanned at each bind (`levelsClean`, cleared by
  `Surface.dirty` / `markLocked`); its GL record is kept on the resource (`glOwner` / `glRec` / `glGen`: no lookup by
  id; a context loss or restore moves the backend's `texGen`, a destroyed resource drops it).
- Texture / cube / volume sampler uniform locations are resolved once per program (`P.texU`), not by name per stage
  and draw.
- Vertex and pixel constants are synced per stage only when that stage's constants changed; integer / boolean constant
  and bump-environment uniform locations are cached per program.

Test: `gl-state-cache.test.js` drives random Direct3D 8 / 9 sessions over a GL that tracks its effective state and checks
that every draw sees the same GL state, and every upload the same data, with and without these caches.

## Measuring within a session

Harness inputs (tools/headless.mjs): `dbg:ORTHROS_API_OPT_OFF=1` switches all of the above off (`=` back on);
`dbg:ORTHROS_GL_NOCACHE=1` only the backend's caches; `dbg:ORTHROS_D3DX_FAST_OFF=1` only the JIT fast paths;
`dbg:ORTHROS_FX_BIND_OFF=1` only the effect binding above (raw words, versions, sampler shortcut, resolved methods).
Scenarios `tools/scenarios/{bfme2,rotwk}-apiopt-{ab,ba}.txt` alternate 20 s phases on / off in play (both orders),
`{bfme2,rotwk}-fxbind-ab.txt` the same for the effect binding. Tools: `tools/draw-bench.mjs` (device + backend per draw
over a counting GL), `tools/setter-bench.mjs` (the queued setters), `tools/effect-bind-bench.mjs` (effect setters and
binds, `--base <tree>` against another checkout). Test of the effect binding: `d3dx9-effect-bind.test.js` (random
sessions against the reference path, registers bit for bit).
