# Contributing to BottleShip

Thanks for your interest! BottleShip is a low-level systems project — an x86 HLE engine that
re-implements the Windows API on web platform APIs. This guide covers how to build it, the
conventions we hold to, and how to get a change merged.

## Ground rules

- **Bring your own games.** Do **not** commit copyrighted game files, box art you don't have
  the right to redistribute, decompiled/leaked source, or vendored proprietary SDK headers.
  Test fixtures must be freeware/shareware/demo content that is legal to redistribute.
- **Cite behavior, don't copy code.** Referencing what Windows (or Wine, as observed
  behavior — its conformance tests especially) does is encouraged; copying implementation
  code from differently-licensed projects (e.g. Wine, LGPL) is not.
- **Faithful, generic recreations — no per-game hacks.** Implement WinAPI/COM/graphics as a
  faithful recreation of the real documented behavior (ABI, struct layouts, error codes, edge
  cases). Never branch on a game's name/exe/hash or hardcode a magic offset for one title. If
  a game misbehaves, find the generic layer bug and fix it so *every* game on that path
  benefits. `if (game === …)` is a smell.
- **Performance is part of correctness.** Hot paths are zero-allocation and cache-friendly
  (data-oriented design); GPU work is batched. A correct-but-slow path that starves the audio
  pump or frame loop isn't acceptable.

## Contributing with an AI agent

AI-assisted contributions are a first-class path here, not a tolerated one — the repo ships
the agent infrastructure (`CLAUDE.md` as system prompt, the self-judging automation harness)
that makes them verifiable. If you want to bring up the game you care about with an agent
doing the systems work, start with [`docs/contributing-with-ai.md`](docs/contributing-with-ai.md).
The ground rules above apply doubly: you own what you submit — run the loop, read the diff,
and back the faithfulness claim with a public citation.

## Getting set up

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>   # vendor/v86 is a submodule
cd bottleship
bun install
bun run dev                                  # http://localhost:5174
```

If you forgot `--recurse-submodules`: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

Requirements: [Bun](https://bun.sh/), a WebGPU-capable browser (Chrome/Edge 113+). The
engine core (`vendor/v86`) is Rust→WASM; rebuilding it needs the `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
target, clang, and Node — see `vendor/v86/build-wasm.sh`. You only need that if you change
the emulator core; most work is in TypeScript and needs no WASM rebuild.

## The quality gate (required before every PR)

Run these in order; all must be green:

```bash
bun tools/generate-index.ts          # regenerate module indexes
bun tools/validate-signatures.ts     # WinAPI signatures vs reference data
bun tools/validate-struct-offsets.ts # struct layout/offset checks
bun run typecheck
bun test
```

## Project layout

| Path | What lives there |
|------|------------------|
| `src/worker/core/` | CPU/scheduler, thunk dispatcher, memory/address-space, HLE framework |
| `src/worker/modules/` | WinAPI module implementations (kernel32, user32, gdi32, d3d9, dsound, …) |
| `src/worker/backends/webgpu/` | DirectDraw/Direct3D → WebGPU translation + post-FX |
| `src/worker/runtime/` | Virtual file system, bundle loader, input, dialogs |
| `src/app/`, `src/harness/` | React host UI and the main-thread automation harness |
| `packages/` | Standalone libraries (archive formats, repack) with no engine dependency |
| `tools/` | Build, bundling (`make-wgb`, `wgb`), the harness CLI, RE service, validators |
| `vendor/v86/` | The x86 emulator core (Rust→WASM), a submodule |

## Conventions

- **Safe memory access.** Use the `Mem.read*/write*` accessors, not raw typed-array indexing,
  in new/changed code. Debug builds validate accesses against the region map and permissions.
- **Zero-allocation hot paths.** Prefer flat arrays and reused `StructView` flyweights over
  allocating object trees in per-frame / per-call loops.
- **Comments are for the non-obvious.** Explain *why*, state invariants precisely, and don't
  narrate what the code already says. No multi-paragraph history/changelog blocks in code.
- **Top-level imports only** (`import type` where possible); no inline `require`/dynamic import
  for types.

## Adding a WinAPI function

Most modules are made of small "atomic" implementation files that are aggregated by a
generated `index.ts`. To add a function:

1. Implement it in the relevant module under `src/worker/modules/<dll>/`.
2. Register it with the correct **stdcall argument count** (this drives the thunk's `RET N`).
   A wrong count corrupts the stack — `validate-signatures` cross-checks against the reference
   `*.sig.json`, so add the export there if it's missing.
3. Run the quality gate.

If a function is a hot path (sync primitive, timer, math, string/memory), consider the WASM
hypercall tiers before adding a JS thunk — but the JS implementation is always a required
fallback, never remove it.

## Debugging

BottleShip ships an automation harness that wraps "load a game, drive it, see what happened"
into fluent, self-judging verbs (`bun tools/harness.ts …`, `window.__BS__.harness`). See
[`docs/harness.md`](docs/harness.md). When something behaves oddly, pull a `report()` first —
it's one structured snapshot with CPU regs, the module-labelled call stack, the recent WinAPI
ring, the unimplemented-stub registry, and recent page faults.

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused; match the surrounding code's style and comment density.
- Include what you did to verify the change actually works (which game/flow you drove, not
  just that it typechecks).
- Green quality gate is required.
